#### Task 9 - GROUP ASSIGNMENT

*For this assignment you and your group are to apply what you have learned in the two data visualisation labs. The task is to be creative and make a really nice plot using the `SPE_ENV` data set*

The data set in question corresponds to a pit latrine study carried out by Torondel *et al.* (<https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.12334>), in which nutrients and bacterial operational taxonomic units were analysed from samples obtained from Tanzania and Vietnam. Our group sought to explore how the pH and temperature affected the growth of the different type of Proteobacteria.

1.  Load libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(tidymodels)
library(scales)
library(patchwork)
```

2.  Load data

```{r}
#| echo: false
SPE_ENV <- read_tsv(file = "data/SPE_ENV.tsv")

proteobacteria=c("Alphaproteobacteria","Betaproteobacteria", "Deltaproteobacteria", "Gammaproteobacteria", "Epsilonproteobacteria")
SPE_proteo <- SPE_ENV |>
  filter(Taxa %in% proteobacteria)

```

3.  Make the plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(SPE_proteo, aes(x = pH,
                       y = Temp,
                       size=OTU_Count,
                       color=site)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Proteobacteria by Temperature and pH",
       x = "pH",
       y = "Temperature",
       caption="Data from Torondel et al. (2016)",
       color="Site") +
  facet_wrap(~Taxa) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

As shown in the plots constructed in the tasks 2-4, the Vietnam latrines present lower temperatures than those found in Tanzania. The pH levels are similar, the Vietnam latrines presenting slightly more variability. Regarding the taxonomy, some types of Proteobacteria seem to be influenced by these environmental conditions. Both Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria present a much higher "OTU_Count" (more species are present) under the Vietnamese latrine conditions, whilst Betaproteobacteria are favoured in Tanzania.
